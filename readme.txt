Simple plugin that adds an animated hamburger menù widget to Elementor ( Elementor PRO required ).


== Description ==

Animated Hamburger for Elementor adds a new lightweight widget to your Elementor builder.

= Linked to popups =

This hamburger menù is directly linked to an Elementor popup: add the widget to your Elementor page and choose the Elementor popup to trigger.

= Animations =

Tons of animations and a preview button to see them in action before actually selecting them.

= Basic usage =

With Elementor, when you want the mobile menù to be more complex or graphically better than the standard dropdown, you need to create a popup. Let's call this popup "Mobile Menù Popup". With this widget you can easily implement an hamburger menù that on click trigger the "Mobile Menù Popup".

1 - Create a cool popup that will be used as mobile menù
2 - In your header set your navigation menù as hidden on smartphone ( tablet too if you want )
3 - In your header add **Animated Hamburger for Elementor** widget and make it visible only on smartphone ( or tablet )
4 - Profit

Check a live example ( change view to smartphone to see the widget how it behaves )
